# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

Amazon provides a few tools to help you with this.
CodeGuru can be used both in development and help withh code reviews to detect critical issues, and security vulnerabilities.
The other thing it can do is profile code to understand where expensive and inefficient code is located.

Snyke is a company that provides tools for both container scanning and infrastructure as code checks.

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

I added Snyke Infrastrucutre as Code scanning to my pipeline.
<https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/>

### Example vulnerability

Terraform files that contain sensitive information. Or permissions that are too open.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

I added Snyk Container Scanning to my pipeline.
<https://snyk.io/product/container-security/>

### Example vulnerability

Vulnerabilities when creating containers does not only occur at build time, but also at runtime.
Third party dependencies might have security vulnerabilities that are only discovered weeks after deployment.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS GuardDuty is a service that can be used to detect and protect against security vulnerabilities in your AWS environment.

### Example vulnerability

IAM policies that are to open and allows too much access. Changes to polices to make the less restrictive.
Disable 2FA and change passwords.
