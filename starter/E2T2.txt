Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The Amazon Inspector found that both UDP and TCP ports for Telnet, FTP, and SSH are reachable from the internet.

Security Hub recommends that:
- http headers should be dropped.
- HTTP traffic should be redirected to HTTPS.
- S3 buckets should use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption for requests.
- S3 bucket should have server side encryption enabled.
- S3 bucket should have access logging enabled.
- S3 secret bucket should have bucket level public access restricted to group.
- EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- S3 enable bucket encryption.
- Remove VPC security group for WebAppSG that allows all ports to be open.
- Add AWS WAF to protect the Load Balancer
