# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

- I use the provided instance of AWS from Udacity and no CloudWatch exists for any of the EC2 instances.
Therefore, did not GuardDuty detect any brute force attack against the Web Service Instance

The E3-screenshots folder contains three images:
- E3T1_guardduty.png - GuardDuty Findings view and CloudWatch EC2 activity view.
- E3T2_hhydra_attack_console.png - terminal session showing Hydra attack on Web Service Instance.
- E3T2_s3breach.png - terminal session showing access and content of secret recipe.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

To my understanding the source seems to be CloudWatch logs


I found this article how to defend against SSH brute force attacks with GuardDuty:
