# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Adding AWS WAF to the web application instance will reduce the attack surface of the web application instance.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

The VPC private endpoints would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It would only restrict resource that can access the S3 bucket to the new VPC private endpoint.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

The answer is no. The encryption setting is only applied to new data that is uploaded to the bucket.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The state will be adjusted to the same as the original cloud formation template.
